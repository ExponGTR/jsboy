An emulator for the Nintendo Game Boy made by Adil Khan and Rounak Kumar under the supervision of Prof Jimson Mathew, for the course CS1201 "Data Structures". It emulates the Sharp LR35902's SoC. A lot of development is pending (more MBCs, sounds, frame rate correction etc.)

This emulator was a mini-project and was originally submitted on 14 April 2025 to Prof Jimson Mathew for evaluation. I have published it on GitHub in hopes of finding someone else interested in developing this further.
Credits to Rounak Kumar for the work on the UI.
